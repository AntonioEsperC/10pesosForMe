It's My Life, Bon Jovi
This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for the faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice
When I shout it out loud
It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said
I did it my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
This is for the ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky
Got to make your own breaks
It's my life
And it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said
I did it my way
I just want to live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life
Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down
It's my life
And it's now or never
'Cause I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said
I did it my way
I just want to live while I'm alive
It's my life
And it's now or never
'Cause I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said
I did it my way
I just want to live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life!

This Ain't A Love Song, Bon Jovi
I should have seen it coming when the roses died
should have seen the end of summer in your eyes
I should have listened when you said goodnight
You really meant goodbye
And baby, ain't it funny, how you never ever learn to fall?
You're really on your knees when you think you're standing tall
but only fools are 'know-it-alls' and I played that fool for you
I cried and I cried, there were nights that I died for you, baby
I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy, baby
If the love that I got for you's gone, if the river I cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song
Baby, I thought you and me would stand the test of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind. I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancing at The Masquerade
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
You and I were the renegades, some things never change
It made me so mad 'cause I wanted it bad for us baby
Now it's so sad that whatever we had ain't worth saving, oh
If the love that I got for you's gone, if the river I cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song
If the pain that I'm feeling so strong is the reason that I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong, yeah, I'm wrong, this ain't a love song
I cried and I cried, there were nights that I died for you, baby
I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy, baby
If the love that I got for you's gone, if the river I cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah, I'm wrong, this ain't a love song
Then I'm wrong, yeah, I'm wrong, this ain't a love song
Then I'm wrong, yeah, I'm wrong, this ain't a love song

Always, Bon Jovi
This Romeo is bleeding, but you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up
It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see I've always been a fighter
But without you I give up
Now I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me
Yeah I, will love you, baby
Always and I'll be there
Forever and a day, always
I'll be there, till the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
I know when I die you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always
Now your picture's that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh
Some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
Touch your lips, to hold you near,
When you say your prayers, try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words
You've been needing to hear, I'll wish I was him
'Cause these words are mine, to say to you
'Til the end of time
Yeah I, will love you, baby
Always and I'll be there
Forever and a day, always
If you told me to cry for you, I could
If you told me to die for you, I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you
Well, there ain't no luck in these loaded dice
But baby, if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams, and our old lives,
We'll find a place, where the sun still shines
Yeah I, will love you, baby
Always and I'll be there
Forever and a day, always
I'll be there, till the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
I know when I die you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always
Always

Wanted Dead or Alive, Bon Jovi
It's all the same, only the names will change
Everyday, it seems we're wastin' away
Another place where the faces are so cold
I drive all night just to get back home
I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
Wanted dead or alive
Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days
The people I meet always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day
By the bottle that you drink
And times when you're all alone all you do is think
I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive
Wanted (wanted) dead or alive
Oh, and I ride!
Oh, and I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
I walk these streets
A loaded six-string on my back
I play for keeps 'cause I might not make it back
I been everywhere, still, I'm standing tall
I've seen a million faces
And I've rocked them all
I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive
I'm a cowboy, I got the night on my side
I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive
And I ride, dead or alive
I still drive (I still drive) dead or alive
Dead or alive, dead or alive, dead or alive, dead or alive

You Give Love A Bad Name, Bon Jovi
Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
Darlin'
You give love a bad name
An angel's smile is what you sell
You promise me heaven, then put me through Hell
Chains of love got a hold on me
When passions a prison, you can't break free
Oh, you're a loaded gun, yeah
Oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me
The damage is done
Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
You give love, a bad name
Paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye
Oh, you're a loaded gun
Oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me
The damage is done
Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
You give love, oh!
Oh!
Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
You give love
You give love (Bad name)

Bed Of Roses, Bon Jovi
Sitting here wasted and wounded
At this old piano
Trying hard to capture
The moment this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of vodka
Is still lodged in my head
And some blond gave me nightmares
I think she is still in my bed
As I dream about movies
They won't make of me when I'm dead
With an ironclad fist I wake up and
French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps
Its own beat in my head
While we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and
What you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need
I want to lay you down on a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed on nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on bed of roses
Well I'm so far away
That each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night
Just to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time
Or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper,
Baby blind love is true
I want to lay you down on a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed on nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on bed of roses
The hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died
When you close your eyes
Know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight I won't be alone
But you know that don't
Mean I'm not lonely I've got nothing to prove
For it's you that I'd die to defend
I want to lay you down on a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed on nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on bed of roses

I'll Be There For You, Bon Jovi
I guess this time you're really leaving
I heard your suitcase say goodbye
Well as my broken heart lies bleeding
You say true love is suicide
You say you've cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimming for the shore
You left me drowning in my tears
And you won't save me anymore
I'm praying to God you'll give me one more chance girl
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe, I want to be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you
I know you know we've had some good times
Now they have their own hiding place
Well I can promise you tomorrow
But I can't buy back yesterday
And baby you know my hands are dirty
But I wanted to be your Valentine
I'll be the water when you get thirsty baby
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you
I wasn't there when you were happy
And I wasn't there when you were down
Didn't mean to miss your birthday baby
I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you

Have A Nice Day, Bon Jovi
Why, you want to tell me how to live my life?
Who, are you to tell me if it's black or white?
Mama, can you hear me? Try to understand
Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man
My daddy lived the lie, it's just the price that he paid
Sacrificed his life, just slavin' away
Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto
It gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Take a look around you, look nothing's what it seems
We're living in a broken home of hopes and dreams
Let me be the first to shake a helping hand
Everybody, pray enough to take a stand
I knocked on every door, on every dead end street
Looking for forgiveness
What's left to believe?
Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto
It gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto
It gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
When the world keeps trying, to drag me down
I've gotta raise my hands, gonna stand my ground
Well I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day

Never Say Goodbye, Bon Jovi
As I sit in this smokey room
The night about to end
I pass my time with strangers
But this bottle's my only friend
Remember when we used to park
On Butler Street out in the dark
Remember when we lost the keys
And you lost more than that in my backseat
Remember how we used to talk
About busting out, we'd break their hearts
Together, forever
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hoping it would never end
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on, we got to try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye
Remember days of skipping school
Racing cars and being cool
With a six pack and the radio
We didn't need no place to go
Remember at the prom that night
You and me we had a fight
But the band they played our favorite song
And I held you in my arms so strong
We danced so close
We danced so slow
And I swore I'd never let you go
Together, forever
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hoping it would never end
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on, we got to try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye
I guess you'd say we used to talk
About busting out
We'd break their hearts
Together, forever
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hoping it would never end
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on, we got to try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye

Thank You For Loving Me, Bon Jovi
It's hard for me to say the things
I want to say sometimes
There's no one here but you and me
And that broken old street light
Lock the doors
We'll leave the world outside
All I've got to give to you
Are these five words when I
Thank you for loving me
For being my eyes
When I couldn't see
For parting my lips
When I couldn't breathe
Thank you for loving me
Thank you for loving me
I never knew I had a dream
Until that dream was you
When I look into your eyes
The sky's a different blue
Cross my heart
I wear no disguise
If I tried, you'd make believe
That you believed my lies
Thank you for loving me
For being my eyes
When I couldn't see
For parting my lips
When I couldn't breathe
Thank you for loving me
You pick me up when I fall down
You ring the bell before they count me out
If I was drowning you would part the sea
And risk your own life to rescue me
Lock the doors
We'll leave the world outside
All I've got to give to you
Are these five words when I
Thank you for loving me
For being my eyes
When I couldn't see
You parted my lips
When I couldn't breathe
Thank you for loving me
When I couldn't fly
Oh, you gave me wings
You parted my lips
When I couldn't breathe
Thank you for loving me

November Rain, Guns N' Roses
When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But darlin' when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same
Nothin' lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain
We've been through this such a long long time
Just tryin' to kill the pain, oo yeah
But love is always coming and love is always going
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
Walking away
If we could take the time
To lay it on the line
I could rest my head
Just knowin' that you were mine
All mine
So if you want to love me
Then darlin' don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain
Do you need some time on your own
Do you need some time all alone
Everybody needs some time
On their own
Don't you know you need some time all alone
I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you
Sometimes I need some time on my own
Sometimes I need some time all alone
Everybody needs some time
On their own
Don't you know you need some time all alone
And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, oh yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame
So never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain
Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody

Patience, Guns N' Roses
One, two, one, two, three, four
Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you
I'm still alright to smile
Girl, I think about you every day now
Was a time when I wasn't sure
But you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt you're in my heart now
Said woman take it slow, and it'll work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience
Said sugar make it slow and we'll come together fine
All we need is just a little patience (Patience)
Mm, yeah
I sit here on the stairs
'Cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now, I'll wait dear
Sometimes I get so tense but I can't speed up the time
But you know love there's one more thing to consider
Said woman take it slow and things will be just fine
You and I'll just use a little patience
Said sugar take the time 'cause the lights are shining bright
You and I've got what it takes to make it
We won't fake it, I'll never break it
'Cause I can't take it
Little patience, mm yeah, mm yeah
Need a little patience, yeah
Just a little patience, yeah
Some more patience, yeah (I've been walking the streets at night, just trying to get it right)
A little patience, yeah (Its hard to see with so many around
You know I don't like being stuck in the crowd)
Could use some patience, yeah (And the streets don't change but maybe the names)
(I ain't got time for the game 'cause I need you)
Gotta have more patience, yeah (Yeah, yeah but I need you)
All need some patience (Ooh I need you, whoa I need you)
Just a little patience is all you need (Ooh, this time, ah)

One In A Million, Guns N' Roses
Yes I needed some time to get away
I needed some peace of mind
Some peace of mind that'll stay 
So I thumbed it, now it's six in L.A.
Maybe a greyhound could be my way 
Police and niggers, that's right 
Get outta my way
Don't need to buy none of your 
Gold chains today
Now don't need no bracelets 
Clamped in front of my back
Just need my ticket 'till then
Won't you cut me some slack
You're one in a million
Yeah that's what you are
You're one in a million babe
You're a shooting star
Maybe some day we'll see you
Before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you
But you were much to high.
Much too high... 
Much too high...
Much too high...
Immigrants and fagots
They make no sense to me
They come to our country 
And think they'll do as they please
Like start some mini-Iran
Or spread some fucking disease
And they talk so many God damn ways
It's all Greek to me
Well some say I'm lazy
And others say that's just me
Some say I'm crazy
I guess I'll always be
But it's been such a long time
Since I knew right from wrong
It's all the means to and end I'm 
I keep it moving along
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
You're one in a million
You're a shooting star
You're one in a million babe
You know that you are
Maybe some day we'll see you
Before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you
But you were much to high
Much too high 
Much too high
Radicals and racists
Don't point your finger at me
I'm a small town white boy
Just tryin' to make ends meet
Don't need your religion 
Don't watch that much TV
Just makin' my livin' baby 
Well that's enough for me
You're one in a million
Yeah that's what you are
You're one in a million babe
You're a shooting star
Maybe some day we'll see you
Before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you
But you were much too high
Much too high 
Much too high

Live And Let Die, Guns N' Roses
When you were young and your heart 
Was an open book
You used to say live and let live
(You know you did)
(You know you did)
(You know you did)
But if this ever changin' world
In which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die
What did it matter to ya
When you got a job to do you got to do it well
You got to give the other fella hell
You used to say live and let live
(You know you did)
(You know you did)
(You know you did)
But if this ever changin' world
In which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die

Mr. Brownstone, Guns N' Roses
I get up around seven 
Get outta bed around nine
And I don't worry about nothin' no
Cause worryin's a waste of my, time
The show usually starts around seven
We go on stage at nine
Get on the bus at eleven
Sippin' a drink and feelin' fine
We been dancin' with 
Mr. Brownstone
He's been knockin'
He won't' leave me alone
I used ta do a little but a little wouldn't do
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin' ta get a little better
Said a little better than before
I used ta do a little but a little wouldn't do
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin' ta get a little better
Said a little better than before
We been dancin' with
Mr. Brownstone
He's been knockin'
He won't leave me alone
Now I get up around whenever
I used ta get up on time
But that old man he's a real muthafucker
Gonna kick him on down the line

Nightrain, Guns N' Roses
Loaded like a freight train
Flyin like an airplane
Feelin like a space brain
One more time tonight
Well I'm a west coast struttin'
One bad mother
Got a rattlesnake suitcase
Under my arm
Said I'm a mean machine
Been drinkin' gasoline
And honey you can make my motor hum

In a nine live cat
I got a dog eat dog sly smile
I got a Molotov cocktail
With a match to go
I smoke my cigarette with style
An I can tell you honey
You can make my money tonight
Wake up late
Honey put on your clothes
Take your credit card
To the liquor store
That's one for you and
Two for me by tonight

Civil War, Guns N' Roses
Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before
Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before
My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars
D'you wear a black armband
When they shot the man
Who said "peace could last forever"
And in my first memories
They shot Kennedy
I went numb when I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom
When it's not in your hands
When everybody's fightin'
For their promised land
And
I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers
In a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh
I don't need your civil war
Ow, oh no, no, no, no, no
Look at the shoes you're filling
Look at the blood we're spilling
Look at the world we're killing
The way we've always done before
Look in the doubt we've wallowed
Look at the leaders we've followed
Look at the lies we've swallowed
And I don't want to hear no more
My hands are tied
For all I've seen has changed my mind
But still the wars go on as the years go by
With no love of God or human rights
'Cause all these dreams are swept aside
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross of homicide
And history bears the scars of our civil wars
I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers
In a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh
I don't need your civil war
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I don't need your civil war
I don't need your civil war
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers
In a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh
I don't need your civil war
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no uh-oh-uh, no uh-oh, uh no
I don't need one more war
I don't need one more war
No, no, no, no uh-oh-uh, no uh-oh, uh no
Whaz so civil 'bout war anyway?

Wherever you go
And I'll be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around
I'll be two steps behind
Yea, yea
Take the time
To think about it
Just walk the line, you know you just can't fight it
Take a look around you'll see what you can find
Like the fire that's burnin' up inside me

But you can't have it all, no

Let's Get Rocked, Def Leppard
Do you want to get rocked?
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
I'm your average ordinary everyday kid
Happy to do nothin'
In fact that's what I did
I got a million ways to make my day
But daddy don't agree
'Cause when I try to get away
He says he got plans for me
Get your butt right out of bed
Stop buggin' me
Get up and move your sleepy head
Don't shake my tree

Drivin' with my baby
To get her in the mood
She's dialin' through my radio
And I'm ready to make my move
But what she got ain't rock 'n' roll
And it really blew my groove
It was Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven
It makes me want to scream
Bach, Tschaikovsky, violins
Turn it off, that ain't my scene
Well I'm sorry girl
Here's my confession
I suppose a rock's out of the question?
Seven day weekend

So lend your love to me awhile
Do with me what you will
Break the spell take your fill

You Shook Me All Night Long, AC/DC
She was a fast machine
She kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman I had ever seen
She had the sightless eyes
Telling me no lies
Knockin' me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share
Had me fighting for air
She told me to come but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it and you
Shook me all night long
Yeah you shook me all night long
Working double time
On the seduction line
She was one of a kind, she's just mine all mine
Wanted no applause
Just another course
Made a meal out of me and came back for more
Had to cool me down
To take another round
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing
'Cause the walls were shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it and you
Shook me all night long

The Honey Roll, AC/DC
In the beginning
Back in nineteen fifty five
Man didn't know about a rock 'n' roll show
And all that jive
The white man had the smoltz
The black man had the blues
No one knew what they was gonna do
But Tchaikovsky had the news
He said 
Let there be sound, and there was sound
Let there be light, and there was light
Let there be drums, and there was drums
Let there be guitar, and there was guitar
Let there be rock
And it came to pass
That rock 'n' roll was born
All across the land every rockin' band
Was blowing up a storm
An the guitar man got famous
The businessman got rich
And in every bar there was a super star
With a seven year itch
There were fifteen million fingers
Learning how to play
And you could hear the fingers picking
And this is what they had to say
Let there be light
Sound
Drums
Guitar
Let there be rock
One night in a club called the shaking hand
There was a ninety two decibel rocking band
The music was good and the music was loud
And the singer turned and he said to the crowd

Big Gun, AC/DC
Riot on the radio
Pictures on the TV
Invader man take what he can
Shootout on the silver screen
Sticking 'em up and knocking 'em down
Living out a fantasy
There's a bad man cruising around
In a big black limousine
Don't let it be wrong
Don't let it be right
Get in his way
You're dead in his sights
Big gun
Big gun number one
Big gun
Big gun kick the hell out of you
Terminators, Uzi makers
Shootin' up Hollywood
Snakes alive with a .45
Setting off and doing no good
If you ain't wise they'll cannibalize
Tear flesh off you
Classified lady killers
Prayin' in the human zoo (Prayin')
They saddle you up
And take you to town
Better look out
When he come around
Big gun
Big gun number one
Big gun
Big gun kick the hell out of you
Got big gun, ready or not
Big gun, give it, give it a shot
Terminator, Uzi makers
Regulators, gonna get you later
Big gun kick the hell out of you

Jailbreak, AC/DC
There was a friend of mine on murder
And the judge's gavel fell
Jury found him guilty
Gave him sixteen years in hell
He said "I ain't spending my life here
I ain't living alone
Ain't breaking no rocks on the chain gang
I'm breakin' out and headin' home
Gonna make a jailbreak
And I'm lookin' towards the sky
I'm gonna make a jailbreak
Oh, how I wish that I could fly
All in the name of liberty
All in the name of liberty
Got to be free
Jailbreak, let me out of here
Jailbreak, sixteen years
Jailbreak, had more than I can take
Jailbreak, yeah
He said he'd seen his lady being fooled with
By another man
She was down and he was up
He had a gun in his hand
Bullets started flying everywhere
And people started to scream
Big man lying on the ground
With a hole in his body
Where his life had been
But it was
All in the name of liberty
All in the name of liberty
I got to be free
Jailbreak, jailbreak
I got to break out
Out of here
Heartbeats they were racin'
Freedom he was chasin'
Spotlights, sirens, rifles firing
But he made it out
With a bullet in his back

Touch Too Much, AC/DC
It was one of those nights
When you turned out the lights
And everything comes into view
She was taking her time
I was losing my mind
There was nothing that she wouldn't do
It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
She knew we was making love
I was so satisfied
Deep down inside
Like a hand in a velvet glove
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's gonna drive me insane
She's got a touch, a touch too much
She had the face of an angel
Smiling with sin
A body of Venus with arms
Dealing with danger
Stroking my skin
Let the thunder and lightening start
It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
It wasn't that she didn't care
She wanted it hard
And wanted it fast
She liked it done medium rare
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's gonna drive me insane
She's had a touch, a touch too much, touch me
Seems like a touch (touch too much)
You know it's much too much (much too much)
I really want to feel your (touch too much)
Girl you know you're giving me (much too much)
Seems like a touch
Just a dirty little touch
I really need your touch
'Cause you're much too much too much too much

Love Walks In, Van Halen
Contact is all it takes
To change your life to lose your place in time
Contact, asleep or awake
Coming around you may wake up to find
Questions deep within your eyes
Now more than ever you realize
And then you sense a change
Nothing feels the same
All your dreams are strange
Love comes walkin' in
Some kind of alien
Waits for the opening
Then simply pulls a string
Another world, some other time
You lay your sanity on the line
Familiar faces familiar sights
Reach back remember with all your might
Oh there she stands in a silken gown
Silver lights shining down
So when you sense a change
Nothing feels the same
All your dreams are strange,
Love comes walkin' in
Some kind of alien
Waits for the opening
Then simply pulls a string
Love comes walkin' in
Oh, sleep and dream is all I crave
I travel far across the milky way
To my master I become a slave
Till we meet again some other day
Where silence speaks as loud as war
Earth returns to what it was before
And then you sense a change
Nothing feels the same
All your dreams are strange,
Love comes walkin' in
Some kind of alien
Waits for the opening
Then simply pulls a string, 
Love comes walkin' in
Love comes walkin' in
Baby, pull the string
Love comes walkin' in
Love comes walkin' in yeah

Dream On, Aerosmith
Every time when I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone
It went by, like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way
Everybody's got the dues in life to pay
I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody sin
You got to lose to know how to win
Half my life
Is books, written pages
Live and learn from fools and
From sages
You know it's true, oh
All these feelings come back to you
Sing with me, sing for the years
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

I Don't Want To Miss A Thing, Aerosmith
I could stay awake just to hear you breathing
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
Well you're far away dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
And just stay here lost in this moment forever
Well, every moment spent with you
Is a moment I treasure

Crazy, Aerosmith
Come here, baby.
You know you drive me up the wall 
The way you make good on all the nasty tricks you pull. 
Seems like we're makin' up more than we're makin' love.
And it always seems you got somethin' on your mind other than me.
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways.
You hear me?
Say you're leavin' on a seven thirty train,
And that you're headin' out to Hollywood.
Girl, you been givin' me that line so many times

That kinda lovin' sends a man right to his grave.

You turn it on, then you're gone.
Yeah, you drive me crazy, crazy, crazy for you baby.
What can I do, honey? I feel like the color blue.
You're packin' up your stuff, 
And talkin' like it's tough 
And tryin' to tell me that it's time to go. Yeah!
But, I know you ain't wearin' nothin' underneath that over coat.
And it's all a show. Yeah!
That kinda lovin' makes me wanna pull down the shade. Yeah!

Walk This Way, Aerosmith
Backstroke lover always hidin' 'neath the cover
'Till I talked to my daddy he say
He said, you ain't seen noting
'Till you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changin' your ways
I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder
All the times I can reminisce
Ah the best thing lovin' with her sister and her cousin
Started with a little kiss, like this
See-saw swingin' with the boys in the school
With your feet flyin' up in the air
Singin' hey diddle-diddle with the kitty in the middle
You be swingin' like you just didn't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Was it me she was foolin'?
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
Taught me how to walk this way
She told me to
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Ah, just give me a kiss
Like this
School girl sadie with the classy kinda sassy
Little skirt climbing way up her knees
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was lookin' at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
Till the boys told me something I missed
Then my next door neighbour with a daughter had a favour
Took me just a little kiss, like this
See-saw swingin' with the boys in the school
With your feet flyin' up in the air
Singin' hey diddle-diddle with the kitty in the middle
You be swingin' like you just didn't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Was it me she was foolin'?
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
Told me how to walk this way
She told me to
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way

Amazing, Aerosmith
I kept the right ones out
And let the wrong ones in
Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins
There were times in my life
When I was goin' insane
Tryin' to walk through
The pain
When I lost my grip
And I hit the floor
Yeah, I thought I could leave, but couldn't get out the door
I was so sick and tired
Of livin' a lie
I was wishin' that I would die
It's amazing
With the blink of an eye, you finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight
That one last shot's permanent vacation
And how high can you fly with broken wings?
Life's a journey, not a destination
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings
You have to learn to crawl
Before you learn to walk
But I just couldn't listen to all that righteous talk, oh yeah
I was out on the street,
Just a tryin' to survive
Scratchin' to stay alive
It's amazing
With the blink of an eye, you finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
Oh, it's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight
Desperate hearts, desperate hearts

Sweet Emotion, Aerosmith
You talk about things that nobody cares
You're wearing out things that nobody wears
You're calling my name but I gotta make clear
I can't say baby where I'll be in a year
When some sweet hog mama with a face like a gent
Said my get up and go must've got up and went
Well I got good news, she's a real good liar
'Cause the backstage boogie set your pants on fire
Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion
When I pulled into town in a police car
Your daddy said I took it just a little too far
You're telling me things but your girlfriend lied
You can't catch me 'cause the rabbit done died
Yes it did
You stand in the front just a shakin' your ass
I'll take you backstage, you can drink from my glass
Your telling me things I can sure understand
'Cause a month on the road an' I'll be eating from your hand

Janie's Got A Gun, Aerosmith
Dum dum dum, honey what have you done?
Dum dum dum, it's the sound of my gun
Dum dum dum, honey what have you done?
Dum dum dum, it's the sound
Janie's got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Her whole world's come undone
From lookin' straight at the sun
What did her daddy do?
What did he put you through?
They say when Janie was arrested
They found him underneath a train
But man, he had it comin'
Now that Janie's got a gun
She ain't never gonna be the same
Janie's got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Her dog day's just begun
Now everybody is on the run
Tell me now it's untrue
What did her daddy do?
He jacked a little bitty baby
The man has got to be insane
They say the spell that he was under
The lightning and the thunder
Knew that someone had to stop the rain
Run away, run away from the pain
Yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah
Run away, run away from the pain
Yeah,yeah yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away,run,run away
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Janie's got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Her dog day's just begun
Now everybody is on the run
What did her daddy do?
It was Janie's last I.O.U
She had to take him down easy
And put a bullet in his brain
She said 'cause nobody believes me
The man was such a sleaze, he ain't
Never gonna be the same
Run away, run away from the pain
Yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah
Run away, run away from the pain
Yeah,yeah yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away,run,run away
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Janie's got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Everybody is on the run
Janie's got a gun
Her dog day's just begun
Now everybody is on the run
Because Janie's got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Her dog day's just begun
Now everybody is on the run
Janie's got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Her dog day's just begun

Dude, Aerosmith
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Cruised into a bar on the shore
Her picture graced the grime on the door
She's a long lost love at first bite
Baby, maybe you're wrong
But you know it's all right, that's right
Back stage we're having the time
Of our lives until somebody says
Forgive me if I seem out of line
Then she whipped out a gun
And tried to blow me away
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
So never judge a book by its cover
Or who you gonna love by your lover
Love put me wise to her love in disguise
She had the body of a Venus
Lord, imagine my surprise
Let me take a peek dear
(Baby let me follow you down)
Do me, do me, do me all night
(Baby let me follow you down)
Turn the other cheek dear
(Baby let me follow you down)
Do me, do me, do me, do me
What a funky lady
Oh, she like it, like it, like it, like it
Oh, he was a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady

Jaded, Aerosmith
Hey jaded, you got your mama's style
But you're yesterday's child to me
So jaded
You think that's where it's at
But is that where it's supposed to be
You're gettin' it all over me, ex-rated
My my baby blue
Yeah I been thinkin' about you
My my baby blue
Yeah you're so jaded
And I'm the one that jaded you
Hey jaded
In all it's misery
It will always be what I love and hated
And maybe take a ride to the other side
We're thinkin' of
We'll slip into the velvet glove
And be jaded
My my baby blue
Yeah I'm thinkin' about you
My my baby blue
Yeah I'm so jaded
And baby I'm afraid of you
Your thinking's so complicated
I've had it all up to here
But it's so overrated
Love and hated
Wouldn't trade it
Love me jaded
Hey jaded
There ain't no baby please
When I'm shootin' the breeze with her
When everything you see is a blur
And ecstasy's what you prefer
My my baby blue
Yeah I'm talkin' about you
My my baby blue
Yeah I've been thinkin' about you
My my baby blue
Yeah you're so jaded
Baby
Jaded
Baby
You're so jaded
'Cause I'm the one that jaded you

Don't Stop Believin', Journey
Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world
She took the midnight train going anywhere
Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train going anywhere
A singer in a smoky room
A smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on
Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlights people, living just to find emotion
Hiding, somewhere in the night
Working hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time
Some will win, some will lose
Some were born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on
Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlights people, living just to find emotion
Hiding, somewhere in the night
Don't stop believing
Hold on to the feeling
Streetlights people
Don't stop believing
Hold on
Streetlight people
Don't stop believing
Hold on to the feeling
Streetlights people

Faithfully, Journey
Highway run
Into the midnight sun
Wheels go round and round
You're on my mind
Restless hearts
Sleep alone tonight
Sendin' all my love
Along the wire
They say that the road
Ain't no place to start a family
Right down the line
It's been you and me
And lovin' a music man
Ain't always what it's supposed to be
Oh girl you stand by me
I'm forever yours, faithfully
Circus life
Under the big top world
We all need the clowns
To make us smile
Through space and time
Always another show
Wondering where I am
Lost without you
And being apart ain't easy on this love affair
Two strangers learn to fall in love again
I get the joy
Of rediscovering you
Oh girl, you stand by me
I'm forever yours, faithfully
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Faithfully, I'm still yours
I'm forever yours
Ever yours, faithfully

Open Arms, Journey
Lying beside you, here in the dark
Feeling your heartbeat with mine
Softly you whisper, you're so sincere
How could our love be so blind
We sailed on together
We drifted apart
And here you are, by my side
So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am, with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me
Open arms
Living without you, living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you
Wanting you near
How much I wanted you home
But now that you've come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay
So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am, with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me
Open arms

Separate Ways, Journey
Here we stand
Worlds apart, hearts broken in two, two, two
Sleepless nights
Losing ground
I'm reaching for you, you, you
Feelin' that it's gone
Can change your mind
If we can't go on
To survive the tide love divides
Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you
How we touched
And went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched
And went our separate ways
Troubled times
Caught between confusions and pain, pain, pain
Distant eyes
Promises we made were in vain, vain, vain
If you must go, I wish you love
You'll never walk alone
Take care my love
Miss you love
Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you
How we touched
And went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched
And went our separate ways
Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you
How we touched
And went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched
And went our separate ways
I still love you girl
I really love you girl
And if he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
No, No

Any Way You Want It, Journey
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
She loves to laugh
She loves to sing
She does everything
She loves to move
She loves to groove
She loves the lovin' things
Ooh, all night, all night
Oh, every night
So hold tight, hold tight
Ooh baby, hold tight
Oh, she said,
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
She said, any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
I was alone
I never knew
What good love could do
Ooh, then we touched
Then we sang
About the lovin' things
Ooh, all night, all night
Oh, every night
So hold tight, hold tight
Ooh baby, hold tight
Oh, she said,
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
I said, any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
She said ohh, hold on, hold on, hold on
Oh, she said any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

When You Love A Woman, Journey
In my life I see where I've been
I said that I'd never fall again
Within myself I was wrong
My searching ain't over and over
I know that
When you love a woman
You see your world inside her eyes
When you love a woman
(Well) You know she's standing by your side
A joy that lasts forever
There's a band of gold that shines
Waiting somewhere, oh, yeah
If I can't believe that someone is true
To fall in love is so hard to do
I hope and pray tonight
Somewhere you're thinking of me girl
Yes I know, I know that
It's enough to make you cry
When you see her walking by
And you look into her eyes
When you love a woman
When you love, love, love, love
When you love a woman
You see your world inside her eyes

Stone In Love, Journey
Those crazy nights, I do remember in my youth
I do recall, those were the best times, most of all
In the heat with a blue-jean girl
Burnin' love comes once in a lifetime
She found me singing by the railroad track
Took me home, we danced by the moonlight
Those summer nights are callin'
Stone in love
Can't help myself, I'm fallin'
Stone in love
Ooh, old dusty roads, led to the river
Runnin' slow
She pulled me down, ooh, I'd get clever
We'd go 'round
In the heat with a blue jean girl
Burnin' love comes once in a lifetime
Oh the memories never fade away
Golden girl, I'll keep you forever
Those summer nights are callin'
Stone in love
Can't help myself, I'm fallin'
Stone in love
Those summer nights are callin'
Stone in love
Can't help myself, I'm fallin'
Stone in love

I'll Be Alright Without You, Journey
I've been thinking 'bout the times
You walked out on me
There were moments I'd believe, you were there
Do I miss you, or am I lying to my self again
I do these things
(It's all because of you)
I keep holding on, but I'll try
(Try not to think of you)
Love don't leave me lonely
I'll be alright without you
There'll be someone else I keep tellin' myself
I'll be alright without you
Oh love's an empty face, I can't replace
(You don't need it)
People wonderin' why we broke apart
The great pretender here I go again
These things I do
(It's all because of you)
I'll keep holdin' but I'll try
(Try not to think of you)
All I wanted was to hold you
I'll be alright without you
There'll be someone else, I keep tellin' myself
I'll be alright without you
Love's an empty face oh I've got to replace
I'll be alright without you
There'll be someone else, I keep tellin' myself
I'll be alright without you
Oh love's an empty place, I can still see your face
I'll be alright

Feeling That Way, Journey
Opened my eyes to a new kind of way
All the good times that you saved
Are you feeling
You feeling that way too
Or am I just
Am I just a fool
When the summer's gone, she'll be there
Standing by the light
What she's been through where she's been to
She should know wrong from right
Is she feeling
Are you feeling
You feeling that way too
Or am I just
Am I just a fool
A new road's waiting
You touched my life, whoa
Soft and warm on a summer's night
You're the only one, I told you
The only one I love
The lovely one (lovely one)
I'm thinking of
When the summer's gone, she'll be there
Standing by the light
Once she's been to where she's gone to
She should know wrong from right
Is she feeling
Are you feeling
You feeling that way too
Whoa, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
You feeling that way too
When the summer's gone, she'll be there
Standing by the light
Once she's been to where she's gone to
She should know wrong from right
Is she feeling
Whoa, is she feeling
Feeling that way
Oh, my, my, oh
Feeling that way
Whoa, oh
Feeling that wayOpened my eyes to a new kind of way
All the good times that you saved
Are you feeling
You feeling that way too
Or am I just
Am I just a fool
When the summer's gone, she'll be there
Standing by the light
What she's been through where she's been to
She should know wrong from right
Is she feeling
Are you feeling
You feeling that way too
Or am I just
Am I just a fool
A new road's waiting
You touched my life, whoa
Soft and warm on a summer's night
You're the only one, I told you
The only one I love
The lovely one (lovely one)
I'm thinking of
When the summer's gone, she'll be there
Standing by the light
Once she's been to where she's gone to
She should know wrong from right
Is she feeling
Are you feeling
You feeling that way too
Whoa, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
You feeling that way too
When the summer's gone, she'll be there
Standing by the light
Once she's been to where she's gone to
She should know wrong from right
Is she feeling
Whoa, is she feeling
Feeling that way
Oh, my, my, oh
Feeling that way
Whoa, oh
Feeling that way

Who's Crying Now, Journey
It's been a mystery
And still they try to see
Why somethin' good can hurt so bad
Caught on a one-way street
The taste of bittersweet
Love will survive somehow, some way
One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
I wonder who's cryin' now
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one?
I wonder who's cryin' now
So many stormy nights
So many wrong or rights
Neither could change their headstrong ways
And in a lover's rage
They tore another page
The fightin' is worth the love they save
One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
I wonder who's cryin' now
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one?
I wonder who's cryin' now
Only so many tears you can cry
'Til the heartache is over
And now you can say
Your love will never die
One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
I wonder who's cryin' now
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one?
I wonder who's cryin' now
Oh so tired now, love, love

Wish You Were Here, Pink Floyd
So, so you think you can tell 
Heaven from Hell, 
Blue sky's from pain. 
Can you tell a green field 
From a cold steel rail? 
A smile from a veil? 
Do you think you can tell? 
And did they get you to trade 
Your heroes for ghosts? 
Hot ashes for trees? 
Hot air for a cool breeze? 
Cold comfort for change? 
And did you exchange 
A walk on part in the war 
For a lead role in a cage? 
How I wish, how I wish you were here. 
We're just two lost souls 
Swimming in a fish bowl, 
Year after year, 
Running over the same old ground. 
And how we found
The same old fears. 
Wish you were here.

Comfortably Numb, Pink Floyd
Hello? Hello? Hello?
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?
Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again
Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
Okay
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more, ah
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb

Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Pink Floyd
Remember when you were young? 
You shone like the sun. 
Shine on, you crazy diamond 
Now there&#039;s a look in your eyes 
Like black holes in the sky 
Shine on, you crazy diamond 
You were caught in the crossfire 
Of childhood and stardom, 
Blown on the steel breeze 
Come on you target 
for faraway laughter; 
Come on you stranger, you legend, 
You martyr, and shine 
You reached for the secret 
too soon 
You cried for the moon 
Shine on, you crazy diamond 
Threatened by shadows at night 
And exposed in the light 
Shine on, you crazy diamond 
Well, you wore out your welcome 
With random precision 
Rode on the steel breeze 
Come on you raver, you seer of visions; 
Come on you painter, you piper, 
You prisoner, and shine 
Nobody knows where you are, 
How near or how far 
Shine on, you crazy diamond 
Pile on many 
more layers 
And I&#039;ll be joining you there 
Shine on, you crazy diamond 
And we&#039;ll bask in the shadow 
Of yesterday&#039;s triumph 
And sail on the steel breeze 
Come on you boy child, you winner and loser, 
Come on you miner for truth and delusion, 
And shine.

High Hopes, Pink Floyd
Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before times took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
When friends surrounded
The nights of wonder
Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some sleeping tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river

Hey You, Pink Floyd
Hey you out there in the cold
Getting lonely getting old
Can you feel me?
Hey you standing in the aisles
With itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me?
Hey you don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight
Hey you out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?
Hey you with you ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me?
Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home
But it was only fantasy
The wall was too high
As you can see
No matter how he tried
He could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain
Hey you, out there on the road
Always doing what you're told
Can you help me?
Hey you, out there beyond the wall
Breaking bottles in the hall
Can you help me?
Hey you, don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall

Learning To Fly, Pink Floyd
Into the distance a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a windswept field
Standing alone my senses reeled
A fatal attraction holding me fast how
Can I escape this irresistible grasp? 
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue tied and twisted just an earth bound misfit I
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to guide my way home
Unladened, empty and turned to stone
A soul in tension that's learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I
Friction lock, set. 
Mixture, rich
Propellers, fully forward
Flaps, set, ten degrees
Engine gauges and suction, check
Mixture set to maximum percent, recheck
Flight instruments
Altimeters, check both
Navigation lights, on
Strobes, on
Easy on the brakes. Take it easy. Its gonna roll this time. 
Just hand the power gradually, and it
Above the planet on a wing and a prayer,
My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air,
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night
There's no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, a state of bliss
Can't keep my mind from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit

Us And Them, Pink Floyd
Us (us, us, us, us) and them (them, them, them, them)
And after all we're only ordinary men
Me
And you (you, you, you)
God only knows
It's not what we would choose (choose, choose) to do (to do, to do)
Forward he cried from the rear
And the front rank died
And the general sat
And the lines on the map
Moved from side to side
Black (black, black, black)
And blue (blue, blue)
And who knows which is which and who is who
Up (up, up, up, up)
And down (down, down, down, down)
And in the end it's only round 'n round (round, round, round)
Haven't you heard it's a battle of words
The poster bearer cried
Listen son, said the man with the gun
There's room for you inside
"I mean, they're not gonna kill ya
So if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock
They won't do it again. Dig it?
I mean he get off lightly, 'cause I would've given him a thrashing
I only hit him once! It was only a difference of opinion, but really
I mean good manners don't cost nothing do they, eh?"
Down (down, down, down, down)
And out (out, out, out, out)
It can't be helped that there's a lot of it about
With (with, with, with), without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?
Out of the way
It's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For the want of the price
Of tea and a slice
The old man died

Echoes, Pink Floyd
Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant tide
Comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine
And no one showed us to the land
And no one knows the wheres or whys
But something stirs and something tries
And starts to climb towards the light
Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can
And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
No one speaks
And no one tries
No one flies around the sun
Cloudless every day you fall upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning
And no one sings me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky.

Coming Back To Life, Pink Floyd
Where were you when I was burned and broken
While the days slipped by from my window watching
And where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless
Because the things you say and the things you do surround me
While you were hanging yourself on someone else's words
Dying to believe in what you heard
I was staring straight into the shining sun
Lost in thought and lost in time
While the seeds of life and the seeds of change were planted
Outside the rain fell dark and slow
While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime
I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the moment had arrived
For killing the past and coming back to life
I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the waiting had begun
And headed straight into the shining sun

Brain Damage, Pink Floyd
The lunatic is on the grass
The lunatic is on the grass
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
Got to keep the loonies on the path
The lunatic is in the hall
The lunatics are in my hall
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paper boy brings more
And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
And if there is no room upon the hill
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon
The lunatic is in my head
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade, you make the change
You re-arrange me 'til I'm sane
You lock the door
And throw away the key
There's someone in my head but it's not me
And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear
You shout and no one seems to hear
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

With Or Without You, U2
See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I wait for you
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait, without you
With or without you
With or without you
Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give
And you give
And you give yourself away
My hands are tied
My body bruised, she's got me with
Nothing to win and
Nothing left to lose
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give
And you give
And you give yourself away
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you
Oh

I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For, U2
I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like fire
This burning desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colors will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes, I'm still running
You broke the bonds
And you loosed the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Of my shame, you know I believe it
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

Sunday Bloody Sunday, U2
I can't believe the news today
Oh, I can't close my eyes
And make it go away
How long
How long must we sing this song?
How long? How long
'cause tonight we can be as one
Tonight
Broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across the dead end street
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up
Puts my back up against the wall
Sunday, bloody Sunday
Sunday, bloody Sunday
Sunday, bloody Sunday
And the battle's just begun
There's many lost, but tell me who has won?
The trench is dug within our hearts
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart
Sunday, bloody Sunday
Sunday, bloody Sunday
How long
How long must we sing this song?
How long? How long
'cause tonight we can be as one
Tonight tonight
Sunday, bloody Sunday
Sunday, bloody Sunday

Beautiful Day, U2
The heart is a bloom
Shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room
No space to rent in this town
You're out of luck
And the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck
And you're not moving anywhere
You thought you'd found a friend
To take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand
In return for grace
It's a beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
You're on the road
But you've got no destination
You're in the mud
In the maze of her imagination
You're lovin' this town
Even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over
And it's been all over you
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case
See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colors came out
It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case
What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
Don't need it now
Was a beautiful day

Song For Someone, U2
You got a face not spoiled by beauty
I have some scars from where I've been
You've got eyes that can see right through me
You’re not afraid of anything they've seen
I was told that I would feel nothing the first time
I don’t know how these cuts heal
But in you I found a rhyme
If there is a light
You can’t always see
And there is a world
We can’t always be
If there is a dark
Now we shouldn't doubt
And there is a light
Don’t let it go out
And this is a song
A song for someone
This is a song
A song for someone
You let me into a conversation
A conversation only we could make
You break and enter my imagination
Whatever’s in there
It’s yours to take
I was told I’d feel nothing the first time
You were slow to heal
But this could be the night
If there is a light
You can’t always see
And there is a world
We can’t always be
If there is a dark
Within and without
And there is a light
Don’t let it go out
And this is a song
A song for someone
This is a song
This is a song for someone
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And I’m a long way
From your hill of Calvary
And I’m a long way
From where I was, where I need to be
If there is a light
You can’t always see
And there is a world
We can’t always be
If there is a kiss
I stole from your mouth
And there is a light
Don’t let it go out

Where The Streets Have No Name, U2
I wanna run, I want to hide
I wanna tear down the walls
That hold me inside.
I wanna reach out
And touch the flame
Where the streets have no name.
I wanna feel sunlight on my face.
I see the dust-cloud
Disappear without a trace.
I wanna take shelter
From the poison rain
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name.
We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love.
And when I go there
I go there with you
(It's all I can do).
The city's a flood, and our love turns to rust.
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Trampled in dust.
I'll show you a place
High on a desert plain
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name.
We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love.
And when I go there
I go there with you
(It's all I can do).

Every Breaking Wave, U2
Every breaking wave on the shore
Tells the next one there'll be one more
And every gambler knows that to lose
Is what you're really there for
Summer I was fearless
Now I speak into an answer phone
Like every fallen leaf on the breeze
Winter wouldn't leave it alone
Alone
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we’re in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing every breaking wave
Every sailor knows that the sea
Is a friend made enemy
And every shipwrecked soul knows what it is
To live without intimacy
I thought I heard the captain’s voice
But it's hard to listen while you preach
Like every broken wave on the shore
This is as far as I could reach
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we’re in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing every breaking wave
The sea knows where are the rocks
And drowning is no sin
You know where my heart is
The same place that yours has been
And we know that we fear to win
And so we end before we begin
Before we begin
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we’re in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing every breaking wave

The Miracle, U2
I was chasing down the days of fear
Chasing down a dream before it disappeared
I was aching to be somewhere near
Your voice was all I heard
I was shaking from a storm in me
Haunted by the spectres that we had to see
Yeah, I wanted to be the melody
Above the noise, above the hurt
I was young, not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you, brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way
I woke up at the moment
When the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense
Out of the world
Everything I ever lost
Now has been returned
In the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard
We got language so we can't communicate
Religion so I can love and hate
Music so I can exaggerate my pain
And give it a name
I was young, not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you, brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way
I woke up at the moment
When the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense
Out of the world
Everything I ever lost
Now has been returned
In the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard
We can hear you, hear you
We can year you
We can hear you, hear you
I woke up at the moment
When the miracle occurred
I get so many things I don't deserve
All the stolen voices
Will someday be returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard
Your voices will be heard
Your voices will be heard

Mysterious Ways, U2
Johnny, take a walk with your sister the moon
Let her pale light in, to fill up your room
You've been living underground, eating from a can
You've been running away from what you don't understand
She's slippy, you're sliding down
She'll be there when you hit the ground
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways, oh
Johnny, take a dive with your sister in the rain
Let her talk about the things you can't explain
To touch is to heal, to hurt is to steal
If you want to kiss the sky, better learn how to kneel
On your knees, boy!
She's the wave, she turns the tide
She sees the man inside the child
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways, yeah, oh, ah
Lift my days, light up my nights, oh
One day you'll look back, and you'll see
Where you were held now by this love
While you could stand there,
You could move on this moment
Follow this feeling
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
Move you, spirits move you
Move, spirits 'its move you, oh yeah
Does it move you?
She moves with it
Lift my days, and light up my nights, oh

Ordinary Love, U2
The sea wants to kiss the golden shore
The sunlight warms your skin
All the beauty that's been lost before wants to find us again
I can't fight you any more, it's you I'm fighting for
The sea throws rock together but time leaves us polished stones
We can't fall any further if
We can't feel ordinary love
And we can't reach any higher,
If we can't deal with ordinary love
Birds fly high in the summer sky and rest on the breeze.
The same wind will take care of you and I.
We'll build our house in the trees.
Your heart is on my sleeve
Did you put it there with a magic marker?
For years I would believe that the would couldn't wash it away
'Cause we can't fall any further if
We can't feel ordinary love
And we can't reach any higher,
If we can't deal with ordinary love
Are we tough enough for ordinary love?
We can't fall any further if
We can't feel ordinary love
And we can't reach any higher,
If we can't deal with ordinary love
We can't fall any further, if
We can't feel ordinary love
And we can't reach any higher,
If we can't deal with ordinary love

Paint It Black, The Rolling Stones
I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens everyday
I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door and must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes
I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
I wanna see it painted, painted black
Black as night, black as coal
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black
Yeah

Wild Horses, The Rolling Stones
Childhood living is easy to do
The things you wanted I bought them for you
Graceless lady you know who I am
You know I can't let you slide through my hands
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away
I watched you suffer a dull aching pain
Now you've decided to show me the same
No sweeping exit or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away
I know I've dreamed you a sin and a lie
I have my freedom but I don't have much time
Faith has been broken tears must be cried
Let's do some living after we die
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses we'll ride them some day
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses we'll ride them some day

Satisfaction, The Rolling Stones
I can't get no satisfaction, I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no
When I'm drivin' in my car, and the man come on the radio
He's tellin' me more and more about some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no, oh, no, no, no, hey, hey, hey
That's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction, I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no
When I'm watchin' my tv and a man comes on and tell me
How white my shirts can be
But, he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I can't get no, oh, no, no, no, hey, hey, hey
That's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction, I can't get girl reaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no
When I'm ridin' round the world
And I'm doin' this and I'm signin' that
And I'm tryin' to make some girl, who tells me
Baby, better come back maybe next week
Can't you see I'm on a losing streak
I can't get no, oh, no, no, no, hey, hey, hey
That's what I say, I can't get no, I can't get no
I can't get no satisfaction, no satisfaction
No satisfaction, no satisfaction

You Can't Always Get What You Want, The Rolling Stones
I saw her today at the reception 
A glass of wine in her hand 
I knew she was gonna meet her connection 
At her feet was footloose man 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
But if you try sometimes well you might find 
You get what you need 
I went down to the demonstration 
To get my fair share of abuse 
Singing, "We're gonna vent our frustration 
If we don't we're gonna blow a 50-amp fuse" 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
But if you try sometimes well you just might find 
You get what you need 
I went down to the Chelsea drugstore 
To get your prescription filled 
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy 
And man, did he look pretty ill 
We decided that we would have a soda 
My favorite flavor, cherry red 
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy 
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was "dead" 
I said to him 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
But if you try sometimes well you just might find 
You get what you need 
You get what you need, yeah, oh baby 
I saw her today at the reception 
In her glass was a bleeding man 
She was practiced at the art of deception 
Well I could tell by her blood-stained hands 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
But if you try sometimes well you just might find 
You just might find 
You get what you need 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
But if you try sometimes you just might find 

Miss You, The Rolling Stones
I've been holding out so long 
I've been sleeping all alone 
Lord I miss you 
I've been hanging on the phone 
I've been sleeping all alone 
I want to kiss you 
Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh 
Well, I've been haunted in my sleep 
You've been staring in my dreams 
Lord I miss you
I've been waiting in the hall 
Been waiting on your call 
When the phone rings 
It's just some friends of mine that say
Hey, what's the matter man? 
We're gonna come around at twelve 
With some puerto rican girls that are just dyin' to meet you 
We're gonna bring a case of wine 
Hey, let's go mess and fool around 
You know, like we used to
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah 
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah 
Oh baby why you wait so long 
Oh baby why you wait so long 
Won't you come on come on
I've been walking central park 
Singing after dark 
People think I'm crazy 
I've been stumbling on my feet 
Shuffling through the street 
Ask me people, what's the matter with you boy?
Sometimes I want to say to myself 
Sometimes I say 
Oooh oooh oooh oooh I won't miss you child 
I guess I'm lying to myself 
It's just you and no one else 
Lord I won't miss you child 

Gimme Shelter, The Rolling Stones
Oh, a storm is threat'ning
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Oh yeah, I'm gonna fade away
War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
Ooh, see the fire is sweepin'
Our very street today
Burns like a red coal carpet
Mad bull lost its way
War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
Rape, murder!

Brown Sugar, The Rolling Stones
Gold Coast slave ship bound for cotton fields
Sold in the market down in New Orleans
Scarred old slaver knows he's doin' all right
Hear him whip the women just around midnight
Brown Sugar, how come you taste so good
Brown Sugar, just like a young girl should
Drums beatin' cold, English blood runs hot
Lady of the house wonderin' when it's gonna stop
House boy knows that he's doin' all right
You should have heard him just around midnight
Brown Sugar, how come you taste so good
Brown Sugar, just like a young girl should
Brown Sugar, how come you dance so good
Brown Sugar, just like a black girl should

Brown Sugar, just like a black girl should
I said, yeah, yeah, yeah, wooo
How come you, how come you dance so good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, wooo
Just like a, just like a black girl should
Yeah, yeah, yeah, wooo

Start Me Up, The Rolling Stones
If you start me up,
If you start me up I'll never stop
You can start me up,
You can start me up I'll never stop
I've been running hot
You got me just about to blow my top
You can start me up, you can start me up,
I'll never stop, never stop, never stop
You make a grown man cry,
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry,
Spread out the oil, the gasoline
I walk smooth ride in a mean, mean machine
Start it up
You can start me up
Kick on the starter, give it all you've got
(you got, you got)
I can't compete
With the riders in the other heats
If you rough it up
If you like it you can slit it up, slide it up
Slide it up, slide it up
Don't make a grown man cry,
Don't make a grown man cry
Don't make a grown man cry,
My eyes dilate, my lips go green
My hands are greasy, she's a mean, mean machine
Start it up

Never, never, never stop
Start it up
Ah, start it up, never, never, never
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
Ride like the wind, at double speed
I'll take you places that you've never, never seen
It you start it up,
Love the day when we will never stop
Never stop, never, never, never stop
Tough me up
Never stop, never stop
You, you, you make a grown man cry
You, you make a dead man come,
You, you, you make a dead man come

Play With Fire, The Rolling Stones
Well, you've got your diamonds and you've got your pretty clothes
And the chauffeur drives your car
You let everybody know
But don't play with me, 'cause you're playing with fire
Your mother she's an heiress, owns a block in Saint John's Wood
And your father'd be there with her
If he only could
But don't play with me, 'cause you're playing with fire
Your old man took her diamond's and tiaras by the score
Now she gets her kicks in Stepney
Not in Knightsbridge anymore
So don't play with me, 'cause you're playing with fire
Now you've got some diamonds and you will have some others
But you'd better watch your step, girl
Or start living with your mother
So don't play with me, 'cause you're playing with fire
So don't play with me, 'cause you're playing with fire
